<h2>Image Denoising</h2> <br>

This repository contains a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising. <br>

I have an original set of images. I add randomly generated noise to those images. <br>
I use the noisy images as input to the encoder-decoder model and try to decode original images using the model<br>
